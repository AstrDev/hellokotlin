# HelloKotlin
## Overview
This is a small Kotlin project written for STRV Android Developer Meetup. It covers the basic
functionality that you can use for Android development

## What can I find here?

At the moment the project shows usage of next functionality:
 - Extension functions
 - High-order functions
 - Extension function expressions
 - String templates
 - Kotlin Android extensions
 

## What is going to be there in future?

 I'm going to improve this little app in future. Here's the list of what'll be there:
